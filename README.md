LDATrainer
==========

Simple project used for parsing Java source code at the MethodDeclaration level. Source code from MethodDeclaration is extracted by overriding toString method of Block getter. Then, it is preprocessed and tokenised to match LDA model file format of JGibbLDA library.

JGibbLDA is a Java library to work with LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) in Java programming language. Library is open-source and it can be downloaded from: http://jgibblda.sourceforge.net.
